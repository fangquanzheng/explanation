<p> In the beginning we want to use the style of Middle Age, but we can't found out the appropriate parchment pictures as the background. 
 And there is limited middle Age material we can used when involved with copy right. Therefore, we started to use NEON as our themes, using css animation and side scroll design 
based on display:flex property. There is code of animation around the text-box in order to have the appearance of NEON. Furthermore, we rearrange the layout which make the whole 
 website more appealing and different from other sites.
